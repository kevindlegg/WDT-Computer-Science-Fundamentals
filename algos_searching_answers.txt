Short Answer
1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
    - find a quarter in a pile of change

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
    - finding the tallest person in a lineup with people aligned from shortest to tallest

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
    - seven

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
    - three

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
    - linear: a binary list has be to sorted

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
    - binary: a binary search allows for a sorted list to be split many times to narrow down the search


Programming Assignment:
1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
    
    FUNCTION findWord (dictionary,word,firstWordNumber,lastWordNumber) 
        IF last < first THEN
            RETURN NOT FOUND

        SET midWordNumber to ROUNDDOWN((lastWordNumber-firstWordNumber) / 2) + firstWordNumber
        IF dictionary[midWordNumber] = word THEN
            RETURN midWordNumber
        ELSE IF word < dictionary[midWordNumber].word THEN
            CALL findWord WITH dictionary, word, firstWordNumber, midWordNumber - 1 RETURNING result
            RETURN result

        ELSE
            CALL findWord WITH dictionary, word, midWordNumber + 1, lastWordNumber RETURNING result
            RETURN result
            
    END FUNCTION

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

    FUNCTION netFish(tank, fish) {
        IF tank EMPTY 
            RETURN NOT FOUND
        ENDIF 
        
        WHILE netted fish IS NOT fish 
            IF netted fish IS fish
                RETURN netted fish
            ELSE
                CALL netFish WITH tank
            ENDIF
        END WHILE
    }
