For exercises requiring code, you are free to use the language of your choice.

1. What is a hash table?
    - a type of data structure designed to hold a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

2. What is hashing?
    - process of converting arbitrary data into a fixed-length hash code using a hashing function.

3. How does a hash table store data?
    - each value linked to a distinct key that forms a key-value pair. Each key-value pair is stored in a particular location within an array maintained internally in the hash table. 

4. How are hash tables and objects different?
    - hash tables contain a varying amount of data while objects are more static

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
 - A list of pets and their unique names.
    * hash table

 - The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.
    * object

 - The name and location of every company in a given city.
    * hash table

 - All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.
    * hash table

 - The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.
    * object 

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
function createCustomer(customer){
  CREATE HashMapCustomer
  STORE each phoneNumber(key) within customer into HashMapCustomer and associate with a customer's name and address (values)
}

function lookupCustomer(phoneNumber){
  RETRIEVE a customer (object) from HashMapCustomer using phoneNumber to lookup the key
  RETURN a customer (object)
}

7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.
function addItems(storeItem){
  CREATE HashMapInventory
  STORE each itemNumber (key) within storeItem into HashMapCustomer and associate with a item's description, price and items in stock (values)
}

function lookupItem(itemNumber){
  RETRIEVE an item (object) from HashMapCustomer using itemNumber to lookup the key
  RETURN an item (object)
}

function deleteItem(itemNumber){
  DELETE an item (object) from HashMapCustomer using itemNumber to lookup the key
}

function adjustItemStock(itemNumber, addRemoveNumber){
  UPDATE an item's itemInStock (value) with addRemoveNumber from HashMapCustomer using itemNumber to lookup the key
}

8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.
function addPublication(publication){
  CREATE HashMapPublication
  STORE each publisher (key) and publication date (key) within publication into HashMapNewsPaper and associate with publication description (values)
}

function lookupPublication(publisher, publicationDate){
  RETRIEVE a publication (object) from HashMapPublication using publisher and publicationDate to lookup the key
  RETURN a publication (object)
}
