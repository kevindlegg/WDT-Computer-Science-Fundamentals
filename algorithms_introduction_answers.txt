1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

 - Making coffee;
    FUNCTION makeCoffee()
        SET coffee maker reservoir to full of water
        SET coffee maker basket to coffee grounds
        SET coffee maker to on

        IF coffee maker reservoir empty 
        RETURN coffee
        END IF
    END FUNCTION
 - Washing dishes;
    FUNCTION washDishes
        CALL addSoapyWater with sink
        CALL addDirtyDishes with sink
        WHILE dirty dishes in sink
            CALL washDirtyDish with sink
        END WHILE
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION addSoapyWater(sink)
        SET water to 1 gallon
        SET soap to 1 ounce
        ADD water plus soap to sink
        RETURN sink
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION addDirtyDishes(sink)
        WHILE dirty dishes on counter
            ADD dirty dish to sink
        END WHILE
        RETURN sink
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION washDirtyDish(sink)
        WHILE dirty dishes on counter
            SET dish to clean
            SET sink minus dish
        END WHILE
        RETURN sink
    END FUNCTION

 - A choice of your own.
    Log into Windows

    FUNCTION logIn(user, password) 
        CALL validateUser with user and password RETURN validUser
        IF validUser
            CALL showWindows
        ELSE 
            Display unauthorized
        ENDIF
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION validateUser(user, password)
        SET isValidUser to CALL userValidation
        SET isValidPwd to CALL pwdValidation
        IF isValidUser and isValidPwd
            RETURN isValid
        ELSE
            RETURN !isValid
        ENDIF
    END FUNCTION

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?
    - McDonald's food prep: they perfected fast food preparation and marketed it to the busy family
    - Apple and the iPhone: they successfully marked a computer in your hand
    - Chik-fil-a: brought a non-fastfood restaurant environment to a fast food restaurant - "my pleasure"  :)

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.
    - successful algoriths need to be efficent, cost-effective and solve a singular problem while allowing for some variation in the problem.  the more modular the algorithm, the better as it makes that algorithm easier to adjust
