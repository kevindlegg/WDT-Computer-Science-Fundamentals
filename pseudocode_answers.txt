Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    - for brainstorming and for readability for others.  Allows for laying out how the code will work without considering programming language.
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    - it won't run...errors, etc


Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
    INPUT first number
    INPUT second number
    IF first number is greater than second number
        PRINT first number
    else
        PRINT second number
    END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
        WHILE the number is less than or equal to 100
            PRINT number
            ADD 1 to the number
        ENDWHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
    INPUT a phone number
        LOOKUP phone number in phonebook
        IF phone number found in phonebook
            RETURN phonebook entry
        ELSE
            RETURN "NOT FOUND"
        ENDIF
    
4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

    const phoneBook = [4051111111,4052222222,5801111111,5801212121];
    const lookupPhone = (phoneNumber) => {
        let foundPhone = phoneBook.filter(phone => phone === phoneNumber);
        return foundPhone.length > 0 ? foundPhone : "NOT FOUND";
    }
